Pandas >> 

	- open source python package
	- commonly used for data science, data analysis and machine learning
	- provides various data structures and operations for manipulating numerical data and time series
	- efficient in performing functions like 	- data visualization
							- data manipulation
							- data analysis

Why use Pandas >>

	- high performance data analysis tool
	- working with large data sets
	- supports/loads files with diff formats
	- represented in tabular way (rows,cloumns)
	- working on missing data
	- we can use indexing-slicing-subsetting large amounts of data sets
	- merge/join two diff data sets
	- reshape the datasets

Differnt types of data structures in pandas?

	- Series
	- DataFrame
	- Panel

Series >>

	- data will be represented in one dimensional format
	- can pass 'list' as a parameter

DataFrame >>	(most efficient)

	- data is rep in two dimentionsal format
	- can pass list/dic/series/another df

Panel >>

	- data is rep in multi dimensional format
	- can pass data like above and major axis(columns) and minor axis(rows)


syntax:

	Series >>

		import pandas as pd
		pd.Series(data,index)

	DataFrame >>

		import pandas as pd
		pd.DataFrame(data)

	Panel >>

		import pandas as pd
		pd.Panel(data,major axis,minor axis, dtype)
